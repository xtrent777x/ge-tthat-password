# Randomized password CREATOR

For security purposes many sites and or company's use passwords to verify indentity.

The purpose of this is to show how you can create a randomized password base on requested character amounts and type of character

Base HTML and CSS were previously provided and my function was to create the variables, arrays and loops to make it create password. 

Once responses are completed it will successfully display a prompt with users new generated and random password
